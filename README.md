This assignment taught me a lot about parallelization. In the 4 files we use multiple different parrallelization techniques, 
and this showed me there were multiple ways to address a problem and make the hardware work for your algorithm rather than making your algorithm work for you hardware. 
But in tandem it goes to show that you can write incredibly efficient code that can tackle intense problems. 
I have used a lot from what I have learned in this assignment in other classes and even in my job. I think the concept of parallelization is something is that I can frequently use and will 
continue to use in my job to write faster and more efficient programs.
